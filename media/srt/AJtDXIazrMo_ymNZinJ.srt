1
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,719
You're the light,
you're the night

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,359
You're the colour of my blood

3
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,879
You're the cure, you're the pain

4
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,519
You're the only thing I wanna touch

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:39,039
Never knew that it could mean
so much, so much

6
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,799
You're the fear, I don't care

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,560
Cause I've never been so high

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,719
Follow me through the dark

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,600
Let me take you past the satellites

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,799
You can see the world
you brought to life, to life

11
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,799
So love me like you do,
la-la-love me like you do

12
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,959
Love me like you do,

What are you waiting for?

15
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,120
Fading in, fading out
on the edge of the paradise

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,079
Every inch of your skin is
a Holy Grail I've got to find

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,120
Only you can set my heart
on fire,

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,959
on fire, yeah

19
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,400
I'll let you set the pace

20
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,359
Cause I'm not thinking straight

21
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,359
My head's spinning around,
I can't see clear no more

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,359
