1
0:00:20,480000 --> 0:00:22,720000
You're the light,
you're the night

2
0:00:22,960000 --> 0:00:25,360000
You're the colour of my blood

3
0:00:25,520000 --> 0:00:27,880000
You're the cure, you're the pain

4
0:00:28,080000 --> 0:00:31,520000
You're the only thing I wanna touch

5
0:00:33,080000 --> 0:00:39,040000
Never knew that it could mean
so much, so much

6
0:00:40,680000 --> 0:00:42,800000
You're the fear, I don't care

7
0:00:43,200000 --> 0:00:45,560000
Cause I've never been so high

8
0:00:45,720000 --> 0:00:47,720000
Follow me through the dark

9
0:00:48,280000 --> 0:00:51,600000
Let me take you past the satellites

10
0:00:53,320000 --> 0:00:58,800000
You can see the world
you brought to life, to life

11
0:01:00,800000 --> 0:01:05,800000
So love me like you do,
la-la-love me like you do

12
0:01:06,240000 --> 0:01:10,960000
Love me like you do,

14
0:01:18,240000 --> 0:01:20,600000
What are you waiting for?

15
0:01:21,080000 --> 0:01:26,120000
Fading in, fading out
on the edge of the paradise

16
0:01:26,200000 --> 0:01:32,080000
Every inch of your skin is
a Holy Grail I've got to find

17
0:01:33,760000 --> 0:01:37,120000
Only you can set my heart
on fire,

18
0:01:38,560000 --> 0:01:40,960000
on fire, yeah

19
0:01:41,360000 --> 0:01:45,400000
I'll let you set the pace

20
0:01:46,360000 --> 0:01:50,360000
Cause I'm not thinking straight

21
0:01:51,360000 --> 0:01:57,360000
My head's spinning around,
I can't see clear no more

22
0:01:58,680000 --> 0:02:01,360000
What are you waiting for?
